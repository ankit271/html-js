/*
Closures in JavaScript are a powerful concept that allow functions to have "private" variables.
They help in creating a more controlled scope for variables, preserving state, 
and implementing certain design patterns like currying and memoization.

A closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 
Closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
